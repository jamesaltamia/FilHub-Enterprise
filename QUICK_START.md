# 🚀 FilHub Enterprise - Quick Start Guide

## Option 1: Use Existing Frontend with localStorage (Recommended for Testing)

Your frontend is already fully functional with localStorage fallback. This is the fastest way to test all features:

### 1. Start Frontend Only
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access Application
- Open: http://localhost:5173
- Login with: admin@filhub.com / admin123 (or any credentials)
- All data will be stored in localStorage

**✅ This works 100% right now!**

## Option 2: Full Backend Setup (For Production)

If you want the full backend integration:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd my-backend
composer install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment file
copy .env.example .env

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate
```

### 3. Database Setup (Alternative Methods)

#### Method A: Use MySQL (Recommended)
1. Install XAMPP or WAMP
2. Create database `filhub_enterprise`
3. Update `.env` file:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=filhub_enterprise
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

#### Method B: Fix SQLite (If you prefer)
```bash
# Delete existing database file
del database\database.sqlite

# Create new database file
echo. > database\database.sqlite

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### 4. Start Backend
```bash
php artisan serve
```

### 5. Start Frontend (New Terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
